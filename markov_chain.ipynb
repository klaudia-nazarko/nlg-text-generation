He went to see them three times every day : first at seven o'clock , when he got up , then at three , and lastly at half - past five . There was no plant and no vegetable which escaped his eye , but he lingered longest of all before his one date tree . Now the sultan had seven sons . Six of them he was proud of , for they were strong and manly , but the youngest he disliked , for he spent all his time among the women of the house . The sultan had talked to him , and he paid no heed ; and he had beaten him , and he paid no heed ; and he had tied him up , and he paid no heed , till at last his father grew tired of trying to make him change his ways , and let him alone . Time passed , and one day the sultan , to his great joy , saw signs of fruit on his date tree . And he told his vizir , 'My date tree is bearing ; ' and he told the officers , \""
